Elite Spawn Tools mod for the game SpaceEngineers

This is the source code of: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=933186766

This mod checks the player's inventory when the session starts and if it finds a normal version of the tools (like the Welder, the Grinder, etc) it will remove it and replace it with the elite version of the tool.

I wrote this mod because of the annoying issue that the inventory is not kept in multiplayer.
We got a bit tired of remaking the elite tools every single time there is a crash or a disconnect (and we of course keep forgetting to put the elite tools neatly away).

Might be a bit OP if enabled on a brand new server, since everyone will start with elite tools even without having done anything,
but in this case it might be smart to add the mod a bit later, when the server has been running for a bit.

Many thanks to WeekendMonsters for creating the logo/thumbnail for the mod.

Fly safe.
